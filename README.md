Final Summative Evaluation (FSE) for ICS3U (2019-2020)

By Gordon Lin and Evan Lu

This was an evaluation of what we learnt from the ICS3U class. This program integrates Microsoft 365 with SMS, allowing you to receive, send emails via SMS, as well as receive and send Microsoft Teams notifications over SMS.

No working prototypes are currently active, as well as all the servers linked to this program have been shutdown. Feel free to tinker with the code.
